# Sellum - A custom approach to Callum + Seniply for 36 Keys 

This is my own keyboard layout, based on the Callum layout. I made some changes to improve functionality by adding ideas
from the Seniply layout. One of the main things I wanted was to have different layers for numbers and function keys.
This makes it easier to use both without them interfering with each other.

Feel free to customize it however you like! I hope this layout helps make typing and navigation smoother for you.
